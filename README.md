This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks that I created when completing the <a href='https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python/'>Earth Analytics Python Course</a> from the University of Colorado. The course centres on analysing data pertaining to the Boulder, Colorado floods of 2013.
